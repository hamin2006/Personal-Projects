# Personal-Projects
* My name's Harsh Amin and I'm using this repository to display some of the personal projects I've worked on over my time in high school, wishing to express my intermediate coding knowledge to potential employers
* In each folder you will see a detailed description of each project in a read me file alongside the code so you wouldn't have to run the code yourself to see what I've coded
